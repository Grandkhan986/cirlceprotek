With the bustling world around us, the quest to find your way can be fraught with obstacles. Whether you're trying to track your loved ones or your belongings, the reliance on free GPS tracker apps is evident, with approximately 75% of Android users opting for these no-cost solutions. However, while these apps promise convenience, they often come with hidden hurdles that require savvy navigation of their own.</p> <p>One of the primary challenges associated with free GPS tracker apps is battery drain.

Once seen as mere portals to patios and gardens, these elegant entries have become focal points of vulnerability in many homes. Historical trends reveal that home design choices often reflect societal attitudes towards safety, and sliding glass doors are no exception. The question looms: how can one effectively shield their home against potential intruders? As homeowners increasingly prioritize safety, understanding methods such as <a href="https://circleprotek.com/how-to-secure-glass-in-larson-storm-door">how to secure glass in larson storm door</a> has become essential..</p> <p>Going back to the mid-20th century, when sliding glass doors became popularized in suburban homes, security was typically an afterthought. Back then, homeowners prioritized aesthetics over safety, often leaving these doors unlocked or inadequately secured. Fast forward to today, and the reality is stark: approximately 30% of burglaries involve entry through an unlocked door or window, including sliding glass doors. This statistic underlines the necessity of adopting proper security measures to shield your home.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Security Bars:</strong> The introduction of security bars has transformed the sliding glass door landscape.

For many residents, the garage—often seen as a simple storage space—can turn into a weak point in home security. In Boulder City, the integration of garage cameras with smart door systems is revolutionizing how families protect their homes, but this transition isn’t without its hurdles.</p> <p>One of the primary challenges is the misconception that traditional locks are sufficient.

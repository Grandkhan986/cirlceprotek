Picture this: decades ago, homeowners relied on mere locks and neighborhood watch programs, often leaving them vulnerable to the lurking dangers just outside their doors. However, the landscape of home security has transformed dramatically, reflecting not just technological advancements but also the growing awareness of safety in our daily lives.

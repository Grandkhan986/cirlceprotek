By the 1980s, the average homeowner started investing in more robust locks and surveillance options. Fast forward to today, and the landscape has significantly shifted. According to a recent report, over 70% of homeowners are now integrating smart technologies into their garages, signaling a major shift toward security and convenience.</p> <p>One of the most compelling examples of this transformation is the integration of Xfinity Home Security systems with smart garage door openers from leading brands like Chamberlain and LiftMaster.

The revolutionary GPS tracker has emerged as a beacon of hope for weary travelers tired of the unpredictability of checked baggage. Yet, despite its promise, challenges still linger in the world of luggage tracking. While these devices can boost recovery rates by up to 80%, understanding the hurdles they face is essential for making the most of this innovation.</p> <p>One of the primary challenges is the initial cost of the technology.

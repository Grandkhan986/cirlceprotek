The question “Is your motorcycle hiding a GPS tracker?” might seem modern, yet the roots of motorcycle tracking can be traced back several decades. It all began in the late 20th century when the first rudimentary tracking systems emerged, primarily designed for cars. At that time, motorcycles were often overlooked, but as their popularity surged, so did the need for security.</p> <p>Fast forward to today, where approximately 25% of new motorcycles come equipped with factory-installed GPS tracking systems. This shift signifies a monumental change in how riders view security. No longer is a motorcycle simply a mode of transportation; it's an investment that requires protection against an increasingly sophisticated world of theft. In 2022 alone, aftermarket GPS tracking devices for motorcycles saw a remarkable 15% increase in sales year-over-year, indicating that more riders are becoming aware of the risks involved.</p> <p>Historically, motorcycle theft recovery rates have been dismal, with many bikes disappearing without a trace. However, those equipped with GPS tracking systems have a recovery rate estimated to be 60% higher. This statistic speaks volumes about the advantages of having a tracker installed. Consider a scenario involving a Harley-Davidson owner who, after a night out, returns to find their bike missing.

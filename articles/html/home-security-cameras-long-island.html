Fast forward to today, and the scene is dramatically different. The installation of home security cameras has skyrocketed, with an estimated 15% increase year-over-year, mainly fueled by the rising property values and a heightened sense of urgency among homeowners.</p> <p>What catalyzed this transformation? The answer lies in a combination of escalating crime rates and the innovative technology that has made surveillance more accessible.

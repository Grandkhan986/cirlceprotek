These formidable barriers have not only protected businesses but have also shaped the landscape of commercial security. The rise of crime in urban centers throughout the 20th century prompted a revolutionary shift in how business owners approached safety. The pressing need to transform your business safety became evident as burglaries and break-ins surged, leading to the development of more robust security solutions.</p> <p>During the 1970s, as crime rates escalated in Chicago, the introduction of steel security doors marked a turning point.

This statistic alone underscores the critical role security doors play in safeguarding commercial properties.</p> <p>In the following decades, the demand for enhanced security measures continued to grow. By the 1990s, manufacturers began producing doors that not only provided security but also aesthetic appeal, allowing businesses to transform their entrances without sacrificing style. Brands like <strong>Therma-Tru</strong> and <strong>Anderson</strong> led the charge, offering customizable options that blend durability with design, enabling owners to transform their business safety while still presenting a welcoming facade.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The 2000s:</strong> A spike in security door sales, reflecting an estimated 15% year-over-year increase, signaled the deepening concerns about safety among Chicago's entrepreneurs.</li> <li><strong>Present Day:</strong> Approximately 75% of Chicago homeowners prioritize security enhancements when renovating, showcasing a broader cultural shift towards safety.</li> </ul> <p>Moreover, the installation of a security door can increase a home's resale value by up to 5% in some neighborhoods, illustrating the dual benefits of investing in safety.

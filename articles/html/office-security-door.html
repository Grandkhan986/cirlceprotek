You had just arrived for your first day, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, but instead of the warmth of a welcome, you were met with a locked entrance and an array of unfamiliar electronic panels. As you fumbled with the keypad, your pulse quickened; the blinking red light mocked your ignorance, each failed attempt amplifying the weight of your uncertainty.

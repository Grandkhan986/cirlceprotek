Long before modern technology, our ancestors relied on simple methods to protect their homes and possessions. The transition from wooden barricades to metal locks marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of home security, and it’s a legacy that continues to shape how we think about upgrading our home’s safety today. As homeowners seek to fortify their residences, they increasingly turn to advanced options such as <a href="https://circleprotek.com/security-locks-for-double-entry-doors">security locks for double entry doors</a> to enhance safety and security..</p> <p>In ancient times, doors were often just heavy wooden planks that could be blocked by logs or stones. As societies evolved, the necessity for more sophisticated protection led to the development of locks. The oldest known lock, dating back to about 4000 B.C. in Egypt, was made of wood and relied on a simple pin mechanism. Fast forward to the Middle Ages, and locks became more intricate, crafted by skilled blacksmiths who recognized that security and craftsmanship could go hand in hand.</p> <p>Fast forward to the 20th century: the advent of mass production brought about a revolution in home security. Brands like Schlage and Kwikset began to dominate the market, offering door locks that were not only affordable but also reliable. Today, approximately 30% of burglaries occur through the front door, demonstrating that even with advanced locking systems, many homes still lack essential upgrades to their security.</p> <p>As we navigate through today’s security landscape, it’s clear that upgrading your home’s safety is essential. Homes equipped with additional security measures, such as reinforced door locks, can deter up to 60% of potential break-ins. This statistic highlights the importance of not only investing in quality locks but also in understanding the historical context that has led us to modern solutions.</p> <p>Consider the advancements made by companies like August and Yale, which have integrated smart technology into traditional locking systems. These modern locks not only provide a physical barrier but also offer features like remote access and alerts, ensuring you can monitor and upgrade your home’s safety from anywhere. </p> <ul> <li>Locks from Schlage and Kwikset that offer both durability and style.</li> <li>Smart locks by August that can be controlled via smartphone.</li> <li>Reinforced deadbolts that can significantly increase door security.</li> </ul> <p>Lastly, insurance companies are catching up too, often offering discounts of 5-10% on homeowners' insurance for properties featuring enhanced security measures. By upgrading your home’s safety today, you not only protect your family and belongings but may also find financial benefits that make the investment worthwhile.</p></section><section id="tech"><h2 itemprop="about">What If The Simplest Upgrade</h2><p>What if the simplest upgrade to your home could drastically reduce the chances of a burglary?

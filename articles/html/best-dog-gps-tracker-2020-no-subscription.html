The emergence of revolutionary dog GPS trackers has made this a reality, especially in the year 2020. As pet ownership soared during the pandemic, so did the need for innovative tracking solutions. The growing bond between humans and their canine companions prompted many to seek affordable technology that could provide peace of mind without the burden of subscription costs.</p> <p>Historically, GPS technology was once reserved for cars and adventurous hikers, but as technology evolved, so did its accessibility for pet owners. In the early 2010s, dog GPS trackers primarily relied on subscription models, leaving many budget-conscious pet parents feeling left out. By 2020, the tides began to turn. The revolutionary dog GPS trackers that emerged not only promised real-time location tracking but also offered a one-time purchase price, eliminating the need for ongoing fees.</p> <p>Take brands like Whistle and Tractive, which innovated their offerings to cater to the growing demand for subscription-free options.

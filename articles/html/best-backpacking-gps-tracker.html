The first handheld GPS devices, emerging in the 1990s, were groundbreaking, providing accurate location data for the very first time. These early devices paved the way for the sleek, user-friendly trackers we see today.</p> <p>Fast forward to the present day, and the backpacking GPS tracker market is booming, projected to exceed $2 billion by 2025. A staggering 60% of long-distance backpackers now depend on dedicated GPS trackers or satellite communicators to ensure their safety and enhance their adventures. These devices have transformed how we explore, making it easier than ever to unleash your adventure in remote and challenging terrains.</p> <p>Consider the example of brands like Garmin and SPOT, which have become synonymous with reliable outdoor navigation.

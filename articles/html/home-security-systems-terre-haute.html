Once upon a time, families relied on locks and neighborhood watch initiatives to protect their sanctuaries. However, as crime rates fluctuated and technology advanced, the concept of home security began to evolve dramatically. Today, “Revolutionize Your Safety” isn’t just a mantra; it’s a necessity. With approximately 25% of homes in Terre Haute now boasting professionally installed security systems, the shift in approach is evident.</p> <p>The historical context of home security systems in Terre Haute reflects broader trends in American society.

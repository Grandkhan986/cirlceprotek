Since the dawn of commercial air travel, the fear of misplaced bags has loomed over travelers. The first recorded instance of lost luggage dates back to the early 20th century, when air travel was still a luxury for the elite. Fast forward to today, and approximately 3-5% of checked luggage is mishandled annually by airlines worldwide. This unsettling statistic underscores the need for a solution to ensure you never lose your luggage again.</p> <p>Historically, travelers relied on simple identifiers like tags or colorful ribbons to distinguish their bags.

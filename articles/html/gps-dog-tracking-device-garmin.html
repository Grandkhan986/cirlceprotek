What happens when your furry friend decides to explore beyond the confines of your yard? The anxiety is palpable. The good news is that technology is here to revolutionize your dog’s safety, offering solutions that address common challenges faced by pet owners. As more families embrace GPS tracking technology, particularly from industry leaders like Garmin, the landscape of dog safety is rapidly changing.</p> <p>One of the most significant challenges dog owners face is the risk of their pets getting lost. Every year, millions of pets go missing, leaving owners in a panic. Garmin's GPS tracking collars are designed to combat this issue head-on. With a market share of approximately 20-30%, Garmin is leading the charge in providing innovative solutions that allow pet owners to keep tabs on their dogs anytime, anywhere. Here are some common challenges and how Garmin’s technology effectively addresses them:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Wandering Off:</strong> Dogs are curious creatures, often following scents that lead them astray.

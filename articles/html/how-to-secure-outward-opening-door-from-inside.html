In centuries past, doors were not merely barriers but vital components of safety. From medieval castles fortified with drawbridges to the sturdy doors of colonial homes, the world has always sought innovative ways to protect its inhabitants. Today, the focus has shifted from external fortifications to internal enhancements, particularly for outward-opening doors, which present unique challenges. Understanding this historical context unveils revolutionary tips to secure your outward-opening door from inside.</p> <p>In the early 20th century, security was often relegated to a simple lock and a heavy door.

For instance, the introduction of high-security locks transformed how we think about door safety. Fast forward to today, and revolutionary tips to secure your outward-opening door have become more accessible and effective than ever.</p> <ul> <li>Adding a high-security, interior-mounted bar can increase door resistance to forced entry by up to 80%.

Imagine a time when a simple wooden door was the frontline defense against intruders, often reinforced by nothing more than a hefty bolt. Today, we stand on the shoulders of that history, ready to revolutionize your door safety in ways once thought impossible. With approximately 34% of burglars entering homes through the front door, it’s evident that this entry point has always been a critical area for securing our sanctuaries.</p> <p>Historically, the evolution of door security has been driven by both necessity and innovation. In ancient times, doors were often made of solid wood, sometimes reinforced with iron bands. Early attempts at security included rudimentary locks, evolving into more complex mechanisms as craftsmanship improved. By the Middle Ages, doors were often adorned with heavy iron gates and intricate locking systems to deter would-be invaders. Fast forward to today, and we find ourselves at the intersection of tradition and technology, where modern advancements allow us to revolutionize your door security like never before.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Reinforced door frames:</strong> A simple upgrade, reinforcing a door frame can increase its resistance to forced entry by up to 75%. This basic yet effective enhancement sets the stage for a more secure home.</li> <li><strong>Smart doorbells:</strong> Brands like Ring have revolutionized door safety with smart doorbells that include video recording capabilities, which can deter up to 50% of potential burglars simply by their presence.</li> <li><strong>Keyless entry systems:</strong> Brands like August and Schlage have introduced keyless entry systems that not only eliminate the risk of lost keys but also offer remote access, allowing homeowners to manage entry from anywhere.</li> </ul> <p>This historical context underscores the importance of adapting our security measures over time. The transformation from basic locks to advanced systems illustrates a continuous effort to revolutionize your door safety. As we reflect on past innovations, it becomes clear that moving forward requires not just awareness, but a commitment to integrating modern technologies into our homes. By understanding how door security has evolved, we can better appreciate the importance of these advancements in safeguarding our homes today.</p></section><section id="tech"><h2 itemprop="about">The Wind Howled Outside A</h2><p>The wind howled outside, a stark reminder of the world beyond your threshold.

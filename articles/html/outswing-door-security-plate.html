In the early 20th century, doors were often flimsy, and the idea of securing one’s home was not yet mainstream. Fast forward to today, and we find ourselves in an age where boosting your home's safety is paramount.

Outswing doors, with their inherent vulnerabilities, are estimated to be 30% more susceptible to forced entry than their inswing counterparts. This unsettling reality compels homeowners to rethink how they boost your home's safety.

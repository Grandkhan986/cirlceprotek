A mid-range option might provide adequate security, yet a higher-end model could incorporate fire-resistant materials that justify the shocking price tag.</li> <li><strong>Installation Costs:</strong> Beyond the door itself, installation costs can add an unexpected layer to your budget. Engaging professionals may seem expensive, but improper installation can undermine the door’s security—making that shocking price even more of a gamble.</li> <li><strong>Material Matters:</strong> The material used in security doors influences both price and effectiveness. Steel doors, while pricier, typically provide better protection compared to wooden alternatives. In an environment where safety is non-negotiable, investing in quality materials can yield peace of mind.</li> </ul> <p>However, there are solutions that can help navigate these challenges. For instance, seeking out local manufacturers can lead to more competitive pricing. Many Nigerian artisans create custom doors that meet security standards without the exorbitant costs of imported products.

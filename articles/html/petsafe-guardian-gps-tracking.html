The quest to prevent lost pets has a rich history, filled with innovation and heartfelt stories. From the days of simple collars and tags to the cutting-edge GPS technology of today, the journey has been remarkable.</p> <p>In ancient times, pets were often marked with unique collars or tattoos, a rudimentary method to identify them should they wander off. Fast forward to the 20th century, when microchipping emerged as a revolutionary step forward.

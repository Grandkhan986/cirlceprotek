Their peace of mind came at a crucial time, as their neighborhood had seen a recent uptick in property crimes.</li> <li><strong>Ring Doorbell Cameras:</strong> The Martinez family, living in the bustling Marigny area, installed Ring doorbell cameras after their neighbor's home was broken into during the day. They quickly found that the visibility and deterrent effect of the cameras not only made them feel safer but also contributed to a community watch effect. The presence of the cameras led to a noticeable decline in suspicious activities in their vicinity.</li> <li><strong>Vivint Smart Home:</strong> The Taylor household opted for a complete smart home package from Vivint, integrating security cameras, smart locks, and even an automated lighting system.

The evolution of technology has led to a significant shift in how we monitor and safeguard our living spaces.

Approximately 75% of modern home security systems now offer cell phone monitoring capabilities, allowing homeowners to receive real-time alerts and access live video feeds right from their devices.

This feature is especially useful for those who travel frequently.</li> </ul> <p>Furthermore, over 80% of homeowners prefer cell phone monitoring for remote access and control of their security systems.

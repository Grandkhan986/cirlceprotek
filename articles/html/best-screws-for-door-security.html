It’s fascinating to realize that the evolution of door security has come a long way from crude wooden barriers to the sophisticated systems we have today. The concept of securing entry points can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where heavy wooden doors were reinforced with iron bands and locks, providing a semblance of safety in a world filled with threats. Fast forward to today, and we see that transforming your door security doesn't just rely on advanced technologies; it often comes down to one simple element: screws.

As homeowners increasingly seek solutions that deliver more than one benefit, the dual functionality of security doors has emerged as an unexpected ally in the battle against pesky pests. These doors, originally designed to thwart intruders, now offer an impressive capacity to keep unwanted insects at bay. However, challenges remain, and understanding them is essential for maximizing the advantages they provide.</p> <p>One significant challenge is the misconception that all security doors are created equal.

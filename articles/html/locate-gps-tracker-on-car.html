The journey of GPS trackers has transformed from a luxury for the tech-savvy to an essential tool for safeguarding our most valuable possessions. In the early days, GPS technology was a novelty, primarily utilized by adventurers and fleet managers. Fast forward to today, and the market for GPS tracking devices is projected to reach an astounding $3.5 billion by 2025. This surge is fueled by both the increasing demand for vehicle security and the expansion of fleet management services. As vehicle security becomes paramount, many people are asking <a href="https://circleprotek.com/how-do-you-find-a-gps-tracker-on-your-vehicle">how do you find a gps tracker on your vehicle</a> to ensure their assets are protected.</p> <p>The inception of GPS trackers for vehicles dates back to the late 1990s when they began to gain traction among law enforcement agencies. These devices, once bulky and expensive, have become sleek, affordable, and more accessible. An astonishing 85% recovery rate for stolen vehicles is attributed to effective use of GPS trackers, showcasing their importance in combating auto theft.

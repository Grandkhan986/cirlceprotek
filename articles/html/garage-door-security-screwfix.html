Brands like LiftMaster and Chamberlain started introducing automatic garage door openers, which provided convenience but also sparked discussions around safety. As crime rates began to rise, particularly in suburban areas, the call for enhanced security measures grew louder.</p> <p>Today, the landscape has dramatically changed.

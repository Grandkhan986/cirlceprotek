With approximately 60% of new construction projects in coastal areas now featuring impact-resistant designs, homeowners are taking significant steps to ensure their safety. This isn't just about aesthetics; it’s a necessity driven by both hurricane preparedness and the need for burglary prevention.</p> <p>Over the past five years, the increased installation of security windows and doors has contributed to an impressive 15% decrease in reported burglaries in residential neighborhoods. This statistic serves as a beacon of hope for families who want to forge a safe haven. Imagine the peace of mind that comes from knowing your home is fortified not only against storms but also against intruders.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Energy-efficient security windows and doors can reduce energy costs by up to 25%, making them a smart financial decision as well.</li> <li><strong>Market Growth:</strong> The market for security windows and doors in Puerto Rico has surged by 20% in just one year, reflecting heightened awareness of home security solutions.</li> <li><strong>Hurricane Safety:</strong> With the implementation of hurricane safety codes, homeowners are not just investing in security but also in compliance and longevity of their properties.</li> </ul> <p>Brands like <em>Andersen</em> and <em>Pella</em> are leading the charge, offering innovative solutions that combine style with uncompromised security. The future is bright for those ready to transform their homes. Every window and door can become a stronghold, reinforcing the idea that safety starts at home. As you ponder the next steps in your home improvement journey, consider this: transforming your home into a sanctuary of safety isn't just a choice; it’s an investment in peace of mind for years to come.</p></section><h2>See Also</h2><ul class="related-links"><li><a href="https://circleprotek.com/detroit-security-doors-and-windows">smart security tools</a></li><li><a href="https://circleprotek.com/crimsafe-security-doors-near-me">smart security options</a></li><li><a href="https://circleprotek.com/security-doors-camberwell">smart security solutions</a></li></ul></div>

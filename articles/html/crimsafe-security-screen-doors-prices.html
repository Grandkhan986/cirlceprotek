The premium attached to these products—often 20% to 50% above standard security screens—reflects not only their superior technology but also their promise of peace of mind.</p> <ul> <li>Crimsafe’s patented screw-clamp technology contributes to an average cost that is 30% higher than comparable systems, ensuring that your home remains a sanctuary.</li> <li>For instance, a standard security door may run you around $300, while a Crimsafe screen door could easily exceed $450. This price difference can be alarming, yet many homeowners find the investment worthwhile.</li> <li>Brands like SecureView and Amplimesh offer alternatives, but they often lack the same level of durability and aesthetic appeal that Crimsafe provides.</li> </ul> <p>In neighborhoods where crime is a growing concern, opting for Crimsafe means choosing not just safety, but also a commitment to quality. The shocking prices reveal an underlying truth: investing in your home’s security can pay dividends in peace of mind and potentially lower insurance premiums.

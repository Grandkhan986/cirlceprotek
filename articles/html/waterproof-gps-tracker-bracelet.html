As life gets busier, keeping track of loved ones—be it your adventurous child or an elderly family member—can be daunting. Enter the waterproof GPS tracker bracelet, a remarkable innovation designed to ensure you never lose track again. With the global GPS tracker market projected to reach an astounding $3.5 billion by 2025, the demand for such personal safety devices is surging. But with great innovation comes significant challenges that need addressing.</p> <p>One of the primary challenges is the durability and functionality of these devices in real-world conditions. While many GPS trackers claim to be waterproof, true reliability in various weather conditions remains a concern.

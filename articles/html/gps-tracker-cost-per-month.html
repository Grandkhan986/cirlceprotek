As you ponder this question, you might find yourself curious about the true costs of GPS trackers. With the average monthly price ranging from $5 to $30, the real question is: what does that investment bring you in terms of peace of mind?

After experiencing a series of bike thefts in their neighborhood, they decided to invest in GPS trackers for their children’s bikes. They opted for a well-known brand, Tracki, which charges $19.99 monthly, inclusive of data fees. Within weeks, their investment paid off: when their son’s bike went missing at a local park, they were able to pinpoint its location and recover it within an hour.

Not only does this investment streamline her logistics, but it has also saved her company thousands in theft prevention. By having real-time tracking, Sarah can reroute drivers and prevent potential losses. The small monthly fee translates into significant savings and efficiency—an outcome many business owners might find appealing.</p> <p>Interestingly, some GPS tracker providers offer annual contracts, which can reduce costs by 10-20%.

As you consider ways to transform your home's safety, it's fascinating to look back at the journey that brought us to the advanced security screens available today. From primitive barriers to modern technological innovations, the evolution of home protection reflects our ever-growing need for safety and peace of mind.</p> <p>In the 19th century, homes were primarily protected by basic wooden doors and simple locks.

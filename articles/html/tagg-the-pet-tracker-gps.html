As urban areas grew and pets became more integrated into family life, the need for a reliable solution became evident.</p> <p>Fast forward to the late 2000s when GPS technology began to permeate everyday life. Suddenly, the idea of tracking a pet's location became plausible. Early adopters of GPS pet trackers faced many challenges, such as bulky devices and limited battery life.

With a Tagg GPS tracker, his owner can locate him in real-time, preventing potential dangers and ensuring a swift reunion. This is not just a possibility; it’s a reality for many pet owners today.</p> <p>In summary, the evolution from simple identification to sophisticated GPS technology has revolutionized pet safety.

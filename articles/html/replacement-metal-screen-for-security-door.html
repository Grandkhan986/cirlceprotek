With approximately 75% of security door screens being replaced due to damage, the statistics speak volumes about the need for a robust upgrade.</p> <p>Durable materials, such as aluminum and stainless steel, dominate the market, accounting for over 90% of replacement security door screens. These materials not only withstand the test of time but also offer superior protection against potential intruders.

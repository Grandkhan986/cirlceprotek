The story of home security is as old as civilization itself, rooted in the simple desire for safety and peace of mind. From the ancient wooden barricades of early homes to the sophisticated smart locks of today, the evolution of door hardware illustrates humanity's relentless pursuit to revolutionize security.</p> <p>In ancient times, doors were often rudimentary, crafted from wood and secured with basic locks made of iron. These simple mechanisms provided minimal protection, as a determined intruder could easily break through. Fast forward to the medieval era, where the advent of complex locking mechanisms began to take shape. Large iron bolts and heavy wooden doors became standard, but even with these advancements, vulnerabilities remained. It wasn't until the late 19th century that modern door hardware began to emerge, with the introduction of the cylinder lock, offering improved security features.</p> <p>Today, as you consider how to revolutionize your home security, the statistics tell a compelling story. Did you know that approximately 34% of burglaries involve unlawful entry through the front door? This alarming figure emphasizes the need for homeowners to rethink their approach to door hardware. Reinforcing door frames with stronger strike plates and longer screws can increase resistance to forced entry by up to 75%. It's not just about having a lock; it's about fortifying your entry points.</p> <p>As we look towards the future, the rise of smart locks is revolutionizing home security once again. Projected to see a market growth of around 15% annually in the next five years, these high-tech solutions offer convenience and enhanced security features, such as remote access and monitoring capabilities. Brands like August and Schlage are leading the charge, providing homeowners with options that blend technology and security seamlessly.</p> <p>Moreover, investing in high-security deadbolts can lower home insurance premiums by 5-10%. This financial incentive adds another layer of appeal to revolutionizing your home security. The message is clear: adequate door and window security hardware can prevent over 80% of residential burglaries. By upgrading your door hardware, you not only enhance safety but also protect your financial investment.</p> <p>In essence, the journey of door security from ancient times to the present day showcases an ever-evolving landscape. As you ponder the current state of your home security, remember that revolutionizing your home can be as simple as choosing the right door hardware to keep your sanctuary safe.</p></section><section id="tech"><h2 itemprop="about">As You Stand Outside The</h2><p>As you stand outside, the night air chillier than expected, have you ever considered that your front door might be the weakest link in your home security?

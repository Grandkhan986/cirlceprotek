Once merely a barrier against the elements, it has transformed into a crucial component of your home's safety. In Colchester, where the statistics reveal that around 70% of burglaries occur through doors, the significance of secure garage doors cannot be overstated. From wooden panels to cutting-edge smart technology, the history of garage doors reflects broader trends in home safety and community safety needs.</p> <p>Historically, garage doors were simple wooden structures, often left unlocked, making them an easy target for intruders.

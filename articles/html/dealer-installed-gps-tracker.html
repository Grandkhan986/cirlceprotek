With approximately 30% of new cars sold in the U.S. now equipped with these advanced tracking devices, the question arises: What obstacles stand between you and the security that revolutionizes your ride? The integration of GPS technology into vehicles is revolutionary, but it also comes with a set of hurdles that every car owner must navigate.</p> <p>One major challenge is the initial cost. While dealer-installed GPS systems can increase a vehicle's resale value by up to 5% due to enhanced security features, the upfront investment may deter potential buyers. Many consumers find the added expense too high, especially when considering additional features or packages. However, this is where understanding the long-term benefits becomes crucial.

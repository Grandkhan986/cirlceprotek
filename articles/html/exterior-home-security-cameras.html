The stark reality is that around 60% of burglaries involve forced entry, making traditional locks and alarms insufficient. This pressing challenge has led many to revolutionize their home safety by integrating advanced camera systems. Yet, with innovation comes complexity. Homeowners often face confusion over which systems truly deliver on their promises. This is where understanding the challenges and their solutions becomes essential.</p> <p>First, let’s address the primary challenge: the overwhelming number of options available. With the global market for security cameras projected to exceed $23 billion by 2025, the choices can be daunting. Do you go for a wired or wireless system? Should you invest in indoor or outdoor cameras? Each option presents its own set of pros and cons.

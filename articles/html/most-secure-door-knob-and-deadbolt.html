The history of these devices is a tale of innovation, necessity, and evolution. From simple wooden mechanisms to today's revolutionary door knobs and deadbolts, the journey reflects our changing relationship with safety and security.</p> <p>In ancient times, security was a matter of physical barriers. Early civilizations employed rudimentary locks made from wood or metal, which were often no more than simple latches. As communities grew and threats evolved, so did the designs of locks. By the Middle Ages, blacksmiths began crafting more complex locking systems that featured intricate mechanisms, leading to the first metal deadbolts. These innovations provided a critical layer of security that was previously unimaginable.</p> <p>Fast forward to the 19th century, when the Industrial Revolution brought about a surge in new technologies. This era marked the introduction of the first patented doorknob in 1878, allowing for greater ease of use coupled with security. The revolutionary door knob transformed not just how we accessed our homes but also how we viewed security. With approximately 85% of burglaries occurring through doors, the significance of a robust locking system became clear, spurring innovations in security hardware.</p> <ul> <li>High-security deadbolts can increase resistance to forced entry by up to 75% compared to standard deadbolts.</li> <li>Bump-resistant door knobs and deadbolts can deter over 90% of attempted lock bumping attacks.</li> </ul> <p>Today, the revolutionary door knob and deadbolt have reached new heights with the advent of smart technology. Brands like August and Schlage have introduced remote locking features, making it easier for homeowners to manage their security from anywhere. These modern solutions not only enhance safety but also reduce the risk of unauthorized entry by an estimated 60%. This transformation from basic mechanical devices to sophisticated security systems illustrates how far we've come, yet also highlights the importance of continuously adapting to new threats.</p> <p>As we reflect on the historical context of the revolutionary door knob and deadbolt, it becomes evident that these innovations are far more than mere hardware. They represent our enduring quest for safety and security, adapting to meet the challenges of each new era. In a world where the unexpected can happen at any moment, ensuring your door hardware is up to date is not just wise—it's essential.</p></section><section id="tech"><h2 itemprop="about">What If The Key To</h2><p>What if the key to your home’s security lies in a simple twist of a knob?

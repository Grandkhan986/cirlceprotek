It’s a scenario that no pet owner wants to face. While the idea of a revolutionary under-skin GPS for dogs still lingers on the horizon, the challenges associated with this technology are as significant as the solutions it promises. The advancements in GPS tracking technology have transformed how we think about keeping our furry friends safe, but there are still hurdles to overcome before we can fully embrace the future of pet tracking.</p> <p>The first challenge is the safety and feasibility of implanting a GPS device under a dog's skin.

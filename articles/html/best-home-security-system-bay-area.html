For those who prioritize safety, the evolution of technology has provided innovative solutions to protect your home. One family's experience demonstrates this shift perfectly. The Johnsons, living in San Francisco, installed a comprehensive security system after a series of neighborhood break-ins. Their choice? A combination of smart locks and a video doorbell, which increased their sense of security significantly. Over 40% of Bay Area homeowners have opted for similar smart home devices, reflecting a growing trend towards high-tech security.</p> <p>In another case, the Smiths of Oakland faced a direct threat when their neighbor’s home was burglarized while they were away on vacation. Upon their return, they decided to take action and protect their home with a professionally monitored system. They chose ADT, which offers 24/7 monitoring and immediate response capabilities. This decision not only gave them peace of mind but also increased their home’s resale value by an estimated 5%. With burglaries in the Bay Area running about 15% higher than the national average, the Smiths felt justified in investing in their safety.</p> <p>Even with the rise in demand for home security systems—video doorbells alone saw a 25% increase in popularity last year—there are still numerous options available for homeowners.

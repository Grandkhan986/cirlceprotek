So next time you're locked out in the rain, remember that there's a better way to protect both your home and your beloved pets.</p></section><section id="history"><h2 itemprop="about">Imagine A Time When Security</h2><p>Imagine a time when security was just about keeping intruders out, and pets were often left at the mercy of standard doors. As the world evolved, so did our understanding of home safety and the unique considerations of pet ownership. The revolutionary security door designed for pets is the culmination of this journey, blending safety with convenience in a way that was unimaginable just a few decades ago.</p> <p>The concept of security doors has its roots in the early 20th century, where heavy metal bars and locks were the norm for safeguarding homes. However, these designs often neglected the needs of pet owners, leading to a disconnect that left many animals trapped inside or vulnerable to unwanted intrusions. Fast forward to the late 1990s, a turning point arrived when manufacturers began to recognize the demand for security doors that catered to both human and pet needs. Today, approximately 15% of security door installations now include a pet door option, reflecting a growing awareness of this critical combination.</p> <ul> <li>In the past, standard doors posed a significant risk for pet owners, with homes that housed pets being 30% more likely to experience forced entry.</li> <li>The revolutionary security door designed for pets provides a strong deterrent against intruders, all while allowing furry friends the freedom to come and go as they please.</li> <li>Incorporating a pet door into a security door not only enhances safety but can also increase home value by an estimated 1-3% due to the added convenience and security features.</li> </ul> <p>Another noteworthy aspect of the revolutionary security door designed for pets is its impact on energy efficiency. Compared to leaving a standard door ajar for pet access, these doors can improve home energy efficiency by up to 10%. This means that not only do you secure your home and ease your pet's access, but you also save on energy costs—a win-win for any homeowner.</p> <p>Pet owners have reported a striking 40% reduction in unwanted animal intrusions after installing a security door with pet access. Stories abound of homes once plagued by raccoons or stray cats, now living peacefully thanks to this innovative solution.

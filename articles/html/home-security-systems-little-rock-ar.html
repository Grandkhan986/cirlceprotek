In Little Rock, a city grappling with a 15% higher burglary rate than the national average, the demand for revolutionary home security systems has never been greater. With around 60% of homeowners citing crime rates as a primary reason for seeking security solutions, it’s evident that many are ready to invest in their peace of mind. However, while the technology is advancing rapidly, several challenges still loom large for those considering a security upgrade.</p> <p>One of the most significant hurdles is the misconception that security systems are only for the affluent.

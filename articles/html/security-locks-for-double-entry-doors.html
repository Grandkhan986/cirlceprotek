The reality is stark: double entry doors are approximately three times more susceptible to forced entry than single doors. This statistic serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of transforming your double entry doors into a bastion of security. Imagine the peace of mind that comes from knowing your home is well-protected.</p> <p>To truly transform your double entry doors, consider these must-have security upgrades:</p> <ul> <li><strong>High-Security Deadbolts:</strong> Installing a deadbolt with a longer throw bolt (at least 1 inch) can enhance your doors' resistance to kick-ins by up to 50%. Brands like <em>Medeco</em> and <em>Schlage</em> provide high-quality options that combine style with strength.</li> <li><strong>Vertical Rods and Flush Bolts:</strong> Reinforcing the inactive door with vertical rods or flush bolts can increase resistance to forced entry by up to 75%. This not only fortifies your doors but also adds an elegant touch to their appearance.</li> <li><strong>Smart Locks:</strong> Embrace technology with smart locks that allow you to monitor and control access to your home remotely. Brands like <em>August</em> and <em>Yale</em> offer sleek designs that seamlessly integrate with your lifestyle.</li> </ul> <p>By transforming your double entry doors with these essential security locks, you're not just enhancing your home’s appearance but also fortifying its defenses. With approximately 60% of burglaries involving forced entry, the need for robust security cannot be overstated. The vision of your double entry doors standing strong against any threat provides a sense of safety that resonates throughout your home. Invest in your security today, and watch as your double entry doors evolve into a symbol of safety and style, ready to welcome friends while keeping intruders at bay.</p></section><h2>See Also</h2><ul class="related-links"><li><a href="https://circleprotek.com/upvc-door-extra-security-locks">smart security tools</a></li><li><a href="https://circleprotek.com/extra-security-door-lock-from-inside">smart security options</a></li><li><a href="https://circleprotek.com/security-door-locks-for-apartments">smart security solutions</a></li><li><a href="https://circleprotek.com/travel-security-door-locks">smart security systems</a></li></ul></div>

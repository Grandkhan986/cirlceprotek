Homeowners are now encouraged to invest in additional security measures, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Deadbolts: These locks provide an extra layer of protection that is hard to compromise.</li> <li>Smart locks: Offering keyless entry and remote monitoring capabilities.</li> <li>Reinforcement plates: Strengthening the door frame to withstand forceful entry.</li> </ul> <p>As we reflect on the historical context of door locks, it's clear that the need for security has always been a fundamental human concern.

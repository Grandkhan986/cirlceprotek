This dual approach of physical and technological defenses is what truly revolutionizes your home security.</p> <p>Let’s not forget the importance of reinforcing door frames, which can increase resistance to forced entry by up to 75%. Brands like Schlage and Kwikset have made it easier than ever to integrate high-security locks with sturdy frames, ensuring that your home stands resilient against potential threats.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Yale Lock:</strong> A historic innovation that set the standard for modern locking mechanisms.</li> <li><strong>Ring Doorbell:</strong> A frontrunner in smart technology, allowing homeowners to see who’s at the door, even remotely.</li> <li><strong>Kwikset:</strong> Known for its reinforced door frames, effectively blocking unauthorized access.</li> <li><strong>Schlage:</strong> Offers a range of smart locks that integrate seamlessly with home security systems.</li> </ul> <p>In conclusion, the historical context of door security illustrates a fascinating journey of innovation.

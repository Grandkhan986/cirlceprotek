In Poughkeepsie, the need to revolutionize your safety has become more pressing than ever. The city is not just a charming riverside locale; it grapples with a property crime rate that is 19% above the national average. This unsettling statistic has pushed residents to rethink their security measures, igniting a demand for advanced home security systems. But how did we arrive at this pivotal moment?</p> <p>Historically, Poughkeepsie's neighborhoods have witnessed both prosperity and decline.

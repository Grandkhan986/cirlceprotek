With a staggering 15% increase in reported burglaries over the last five years in Miami-Dade County, it’s clear that the need to revolutionize your home security has never been more pressing.</p> <p>Once, the concept of home security was limited to mere locks and bolts. However, as crime rates have risen, so has the awareness among homeowners. Approximately 60% of residents in high-crime areas have now invested in enhanced door security, including robust security doors and reinforced frames. This shift reflects a broader trend: when faced with threats, communities adapt by prioritizing safety above all else.</p> <p>Consider the impact of these advancements.

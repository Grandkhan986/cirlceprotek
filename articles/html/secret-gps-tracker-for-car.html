With nearly 2 million vehicles stolen each year in the United States, the need for a revolutionary GPS tracker has never been more apparent. This technology is not just a luxury; it’s a necessity for every car owner. Let's take a look at some compelling case studies that showcase the remarkable effectiveness of these devices.</p> <p>Consider the case of Sarah, a small business owner in Texas who uses her van for deliveries. Recently, she installed a revolutionary GPS tracker from a well-known brand, TrackMate. Just a month later, her vehicle was stolen from outside her storefront. Thanks to the device, law enforcement was able to locate her van within hours, resulting in an impressive recovery rate of 85%.

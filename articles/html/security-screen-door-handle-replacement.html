Here are some key milestones in the evolution of door handles that have shaped modern choices:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Early Designs:</strong> Basic wooden or metal latches that provided minimal security.</li> <li><strong>Industrial Revolution:</strong> Introduction of more robust materials and designs, making locks harder to tamper with.</li> <li><strong>Modern Era:</strong> High-security handles with advanced locking mechanisms, such as deadbolts and smart technology.</li> </ul> <p>As you consider transforming your home, remember that the right security screen door handle is not just about aesthetics; it’s about peace of mind. Brands like Schlage and Kwikset have developed a range of handles that not only enhance your home’s look but also reinforce your security. By replacing your handle every 5-7 years, as recommended, you ensure that your home remains a safe haven.</p> <p>Transform your home into a fortress by making informed decisions about your door hardware.

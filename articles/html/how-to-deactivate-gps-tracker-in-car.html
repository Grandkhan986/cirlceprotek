With an estimated 10-15% of vehicles harboring GPS trackers without the owner's knowledge, it’s no wonder that concerns over privacy are on the rise. In fact, searches for methods to disable or remove these devices have surged by 5-10%. Stopping your car's GPS tracker isn’t just a trend; it’s a pressing challenge faced by many drivers today.

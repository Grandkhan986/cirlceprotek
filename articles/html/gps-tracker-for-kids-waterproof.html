Gone are the days when parents relied solely on their instincts and vigilance. Today, the rise of waterproof GPS trackers marks a revolutionary stride in child safety. These devices are not just a trend; they reflect a growing awareness among parents about the importance of tracking their children’s whereabouts. As of late, waterproof GPS trackers for kids have seen a notable 25% increase in sales over the last year, driven by parents seeking enhanced durability and reliability.</p> <p>Historically, keeping track of children was a simple affair. Parents would often depend on verbal cues or physical supervision. However, as urban areas became more crowded and the world more unpredictable, the landscape of child safety began to shift.

In many regions, homeowners may not be fully aware of the audio recording laws that govern the use of these cameras. A survey found that 60% of homeowners are oblivious to these regulations, potentially putting them at risk of legal repercussions. For instance, in some states, recording conversations without consent is illegal, yet the presence of audio-enabled cameras could lead to unintentional breaches of privacy.</p> <p>Moreover, as security technology advances, so does its cost. Cameras equipped with audio functionalities typically carry a 15-20% higher price tag compared to their video-only counterparts. Brands like Ring and Arlo have capitalized on this trend, offering products that promise both visual and auditory monitoring.

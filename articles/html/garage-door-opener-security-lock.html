With about 70% of homeowners treating their garage as the main entry point, it’s alarming to think that this convenience could transform into a vulnerability. The phrase "Protect Your Home" rings truer today than ever. Consider a recent incident in Oakwood, a suburban neighborhood where a family experienced a break-in through their garage.

Investing in advanced garage door openers can mean the difference between safety and vulnerability.

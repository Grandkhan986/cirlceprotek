Security doors have evolved from mere barriers to essential elements of modern home design, offering both protection and peace of mind. Historically, the concept of securing homes dates back centuries, where heavy wooden doors and iron grates were the first lines of defense against intruders.

This not only makes financial sense but also highlights the long-term benefits of investing in security. Consider the story of the Johnsons, who installed Tru Frame Security Doors last year. They not only felt safer but also noticed their home’s perceived value increased by 5%, according to their real estate agent.

This will likely lead to a surge in aftermarket security lock sales, which have already increased by about 20% in the last five years.</li> <li><strong>Customization Options:</strong> Future revolutionary security locks will likely offer customizable features, allowing homeowners to tailor security systems to their specific needs. This includes multi-point locking systems that engage multiple points along the door frame for added protection.</li> </ul> <p>As we embrace these innovations, it's crucial to rethink our approach to garage security.

Panic sets in as you retrace your steps, but what if you had a way to never lose your phone again? The journey of GPS tracking technology has transformed this anxiety into a manageable concern, allowing us to keep tabs on our devices like never before.</p> <p>The roots of GPS (Global Positioning System) can be traced back to the 1970s, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense for military navigation. However, it wasn’t until the late 1990s that GPS technology became available for civilian use.

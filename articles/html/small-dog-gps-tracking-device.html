Thankfully, technology is stepping in to ensure you *never lose your* furry friend again.

Her owner, Tom, was always worried about her running off during their hikes. He invested in a Tractive GPS tracker, specifically designed for small dogs. One day, while hiking in the woods, Bella dashed off after a squirrel. Tom quickly checked the app on his smartphone and saw that she had ventured about 300 yards away.

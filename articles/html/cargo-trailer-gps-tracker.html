In the fast-paced world of logistics, the stakes are high, and the fear of losing cargo looms large. With the cargo trailer GPS tracker market projected to grow by 8-12% annually, businesses are scrambling to adopt solutions that ensure they never face the nightmare of lost cargo. However, the path to securing your assets is fraught with challenges that require innovative solutions.</p> <p>The harsh reality is that cargo theft remains a significant issue, costing the industry billions annually.

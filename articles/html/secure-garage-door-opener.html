The garage door opener, a feature in about 70% of homes, often serves as the primary entry point, making it a target for potential intruders. With garage door opener hacking incidents on the rise—up an estimated 15% annually over the past five years—homeowners need to take proactive measures to protect their homes. Let's dive into real-world case studies that highlight the importance of investing in secure garage door opener solutions.</p> <p>One standout example is the Thompson family, who faced a terrifying break-in last summer.

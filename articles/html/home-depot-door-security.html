This statistic underscores the importance of combining traditional methods with modern technology to elevate home safety. Brands like Schlage and Kwikset have become household names, known for their reliability and innovation. Whether it’s a straightforward deadbolt or a cutting-edge smart lock, the options available at Home Depot empower homeowners to take charge of their security.</p> <p>As you explore the aisles, consider how far we've come in the realm of door security.

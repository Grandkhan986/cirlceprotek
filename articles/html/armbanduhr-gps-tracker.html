With the revolutionary GPS tracker watch strapped to their wrist, they experience a sense of control amidst chaos, knowing they can monitor their child's location with just a tap on their smartphone. However, while these devices offer incredible peace of mind, they also come with their own set of challenges that both manufacturers and users must address.</p> <p>One significant challenge is the reliability of the GPS tracker itself. Despite advancements, many devices still struggle with accuracy, especially in densely populated urban areas or when surrounded by tall buildings.

The revelation of unbelievable prices for home security cameras in India has opened up new avenues, but it's not without its challenges. With a staggering average cost of just ₹2,000 to ₹5,000 for basic indoor systems, one might think the path to security is clear.

Are you looking at a budget brand like Mi or a premium option like Arlo? Both promise security, but how do you determine which truly meets your needs?

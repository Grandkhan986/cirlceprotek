From ancient wooden doors reinforced with iron bands to today’s sophisticated high-security bolts, the methods of protection have dramatically transformed over the centuries. The need to secure one’s home has been a concern since humans first built shelters, and as society evolved, so did the tactics to defend against intruders.</p> <p>In ancient times, securing a door often meant heavy wooden barricades and simple locks made of metal. The Romans pioneered the use of locks, but it wasn't until the Middle Ages that the deadbolt lock as we know it began to take shape. These early locks were primarily used by the wealthy, as the technology was costly and complex. However, as crime rates increased, so did the demand for more robust security measures, leading to advancements that would eventually allow homeowners everywhere to secure their homes more effectively.</p> <p>Fast forward to the 20th century, when the introduction of high-security door bolts marked a significant milestone in home protection. Research indicates that high-security door bolts can increase door resistance to forced entry by up to 50%. Major brands like Schlage and Kwikset have since developed innovative locking mechanisms that cater to both security and convenience, allowing homeowners to better secure their homes without sacrificing accessibility.</p> <p>As we look to the present, it’s crucial to understand the statistics that underscore why securing your home is essential. An estimated 80% of burglaries involve forced entry through a door. This stark reality emphasizes the importance of reinforcing our entrances. Homeowners are encouraged to make informed decisions, with approximately 65% prioritizing deadbolt locks as their primary door security measure.

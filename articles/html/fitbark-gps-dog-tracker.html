Fast forward to the 2000s, when the introduction of GPS technology transformed not just navigation for humans, but also how we could keep tabs on our pets.</p> <p>The FitBark GPS Tracker epitomizes this evolution. Designed to track your dog's location and activity levels 24/7, it offers features that transform your dog's adventures in ways earlier methods could only dream of.

For many, it’s the sheer panic of an open door or a broken leash. The revolutionary GPS collar has emerged as a powerful ally in this battle against lost pets. However, as with any breakthrough, it comes with its own set of challenges. Let’s explore these hurdles and the solutions that are shaping the future of pet safety.</p> <p>The reality is that while the revolutionary GPS collar can reduce the risk of a dog getting lost by up to 80%, several factors can hinder its effectiveness.

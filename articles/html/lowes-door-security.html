The evolution of door security has transcended mere locks and hinges, becoming a cornerstone of modern home safety. If we look back, doors were once simple wooden barriers, providing physical separation but little in the way of security. Fast forward to today, and the landscape has dramatically transformed. To truly revolutionize your home, understanding the historical context of door security solutions from Lowe's is essential.</p> <p>In ancient times, doors were often nothing more than a piece of wood propped up against an entrance. As civilizations evolved, so did the need for enhanced protection.

Fast forward to the 20th century, when the advent of technology brought about the first automatic locks and electronic security systems. Today, smart door locks and fortified steel doors are at the forefront of home safety.</p> <p>Lowe's has embraced this evolution, offering an array of door security products that cater to various needs and budgets. Their selection ranges from affordable smart locks under $20 to high-end steel entry doors priced over $300. Did you know that smart door locks now penetrate 20-30% of U.S. households?

The history of door security is not just a tale of locks and handles; it's a narrative of how we prioritize safety in our homes. Revolutionizing your home isn’t just about the latest gadgets; it’s about understanding the journey that has brought us to this point and making informed choices for a secure future.</p></section><section id="tech"><h2 itemprop="about">What If Your Door Could</h2><p>What if your door could be the first line of defense, equipped with cutting-edge technology that not only secures your home but also gives you peace of mind?

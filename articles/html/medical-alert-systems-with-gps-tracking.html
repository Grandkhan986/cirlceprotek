In a world where one in three adults aged 65 and older experiences a fall each year, the urgency for effective safety solutions is undeniable. Revolutionary GPS medical alert systems emerge as a game-changing answer, bridging the gap between independence and timely aid. Yet, while these systems promise safety, they also face distinct challenges that require innovative solutions to ensure they live up to their potential.</p> <p>One major challenge is the perception that these devices are only for emergencies, leaving potential users unaware of their broader benefits.

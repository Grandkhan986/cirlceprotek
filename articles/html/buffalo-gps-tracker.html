The blend of historical necessity and modern technology creates a compelling case for investment in these devices. Embracing GPS tracking not only safeguards your herd but also honors the legacy of buffalo ownership—a blend of tradition and innovation that every owner should champion.</p></section><section id="tech"><h2 itemprop="about">Imagine The Feeling Of Dread</h2><p>Imagine the feeling of dread that washes over you when your prized buffalo strays too far from the herd.

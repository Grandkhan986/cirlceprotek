What started as a simple wooden door has transformed into an intricate system of security doors and screens designed to protect what matters most. As you consider ways to transform your home, it's essential to look back at the historical context of security measures that have paved the way for today's innovations.</p> <p>In the early days, homes were primarily fortified with basic wooden doors and locks, which provided minimal protection against intruders.

With the alarming statistic that security doors can deter up to 80% of attempted burglaries, it’s no surprise that homeowners are eager to transform their homes into safer havens. Companies like <strong>Andersen</strong> and <strong>Pella</strong> have taken the lead in creating doors that not only enhance security but also complement the architectural beauty of a home.</p> <p>Moreover, homes equipped with security screens are statistically proven to be up to 45% less likely to experience forced entry. This evolution in design and functionality shows how far we've come in our understanding of home safety. But the advantages don't stop there; professionally installed security doors and screens can increase a home's resale value by up to 5%. This means that investing in security not only protects your family but also adds value to your property.</p> <p>As you explore options to transform your home, consider the historical advancements that have led to the sophisticated security solutions available today. Whether it's a sleek security screen from <strong>Phantom Screens</strong> or a sturdy steel door from <strong>Therma-Tru</strong>, the choices are vast and varied. With these options, you can ensure that your home is not just a place to live but a secure sanctuary.</p> <ul> <li>Early wooden doors provided minimal security.</li> <li>The mortise lock revolutionized home safety in the 1860s.</li> <li>Security doors can deter up to 80% of burglaries.</li> <li>Homes with security screens are 45% less likely to face forced entry.</li> <li>Investing in security can increase your home’s value by 5%.</li> </ul> <p>The journey of home security reflects our growing awareness of safety and the importance of transforming our homes into secure spaces.

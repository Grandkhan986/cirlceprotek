It wasn’t until the emergence of Wi-Fi and cloud storage in the early 2000s that smart security cameras began to flourish. Today, it’s estimated that around 70% of smart security cameras are compatible with Google Home devices, allowing homeowners to control their security systems with simple voice commands.</p> <p>As we delve deeper into the 21st century, the market for Google Home-compatible security cameras is projected to grow by an impressive 15% annually.

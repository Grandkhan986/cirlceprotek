The evolution from simple locks to heavy-duty security bars is a fascinating journey that reflects our ongoing battle against crime. Once upon a time, garages were merely an extension of our homes, often left unsecured and vulnerable. However, as crime rates began to rise, homeowners recognized the need to transform their garages into fortified sanctuaries.

These systems marked the beginning of a new era in home security, yet they often lacked real-time monitoring, leaving homeowners anxious and vulnerable.</p> <p>The statistics are staggering: homes without security systems are up to 300% more likely to be burglarized. As awareness of this fact grew, the demand for more sophisticated solutions surged, paving the way for modern security advancements.

Today, visible security cameras can deter up to 50% of potential burglars, highlighting the importance of transforming your home with visible deterrents.

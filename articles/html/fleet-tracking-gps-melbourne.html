In a city where approximately 60% of businesses with over ten vehicles have already adopted this technology, the question isn't whether you should implement it, but rather how quickly you can reap the benefits.</p> <p>One of the most significant challenges facing fleet operators today is fuel consumption. Traditional methods of tracking can lead to inflated costs and wasted resources. It's time to revolutionize your business with data-driven insights.

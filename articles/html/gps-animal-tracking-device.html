The thought alone can send any pet owner into a panic. As the global animal tracking market is projected to soar to $1.1 billion by 2027, driven by both rising pet ownership and wildlife conservation initiatives, the need for revolutionary GPS tracking solutions has never been more critical. Yet, despite the advancements, challenges remain. How can we ensure that these tools live up to their promises?</p> <p>One major hurdle is the inconsistency in GPS tracking accuracy.

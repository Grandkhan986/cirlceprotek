As we delve into the historical context of home security, it's essential to recognize how far we've come in our quest to revolutionize our homes.</p> <p>The journey of home security began in the early 20th century when the first burglar alarms were mechanical devices that relied on physical triggers. Fast forward to the 1990s, and we saw the introduction of video surveillance systems, which were bulky and expensive, making them accessible primarily to businesses. It wasn't until the advent of digital technology that we witnessed a shift toward more user-friendly options.

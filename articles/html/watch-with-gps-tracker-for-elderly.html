The reality is that with nearly 1 in 3 adults aged 65 and older experiencing falls each year, this is a concern that many families share. The introduction of revolutionary GPS watches has emerged as a beacon of hope, offering not only tracking capabilities but also solutions to common challenges faced by seniors and their caregivers. However, while these devices hold immense potential, they also come with their own set of challenges.</p> <p>One of the primary hurdles is the initial resistance from seniors to adopt new technology. Many older adults may feel overwhelmed by smart devices, fearing they are too complicated to use.

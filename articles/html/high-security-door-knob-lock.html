This innovation laid the groundwork for modern locking systems.</p> <p>As technology advanced, so did the complexity of locks. The rise of high-security door knob locks in recent decades has transformed the landscape of home security. Today, these locks can increase resistance to forced entry by up to 80% compared to standard door knobs.

As individuals seek to transform their home security, investing in these advanced locking mechanisms is a proactive measure that pays dividends in peace of mind. The historical context of door locks illustrates a continual quest for safety, highlighting how far we’ve come and the importance of staying ahead in the fight against intrusions.

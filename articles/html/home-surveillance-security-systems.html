With about 34% of U.S. households opting for security systems, it’s clear that many are seeking peace of mind in an era where around 65% of burglaries are residential. So what holds homeowners back from fully embracing surveillance technology, and what solutions exist to combat these challenges? To enhance their security measures, many homeowners are investing in <a href="https://circleprotek.com/home-video-security-systems">home video security systems</a> that provide surveillance and deter potential intruders.</p> <p>First, let’s address the primary challenge: cost.

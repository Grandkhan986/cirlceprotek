As more families invest in technology to protect their homes, they often face a daunting array of challenges. The good news? GE's revolutionary wireless security systems are designed to not only meet these challenges head-on but also redefine what home safety means.</p> <p>One of the most significant challenges homeowners encounter is the complexity of traditional security systems. Many systems require extensive installations and constant maintenance, which can deter individuals from setting them up at all.

Consider this: as GPS trackers continue to gain traction—offering solutions for everything from personal safety to asset management—users will inevitably face the reality of forgotten passwords. With approximately 15% of GPS tracker users forgetting their passwords annually, the demand for intuitive recovery systems is set to rise. As we look ahead, let’s explore how the landscape of password management for GPS trackers is likely to evolve.</p> <p>One trend on the horizon involves the increased adoption of biometric security measures.

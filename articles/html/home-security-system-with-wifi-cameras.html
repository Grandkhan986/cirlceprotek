The notion of transforming your home security with WiFi cameras has never been more appealing, especially with a staggering projection that the global smart home security camera market will reach $19.7 billion by 2027. This surge highlights a collective realization: safety is non-negotiable. Yet, while the allure of advanced technology is undeniable, challenges remain.

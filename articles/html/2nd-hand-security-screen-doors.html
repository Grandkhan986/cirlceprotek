The shift toward sustainability and recycling has also fueled the demand for pre-owned items, further enriching the market. In fact, approximately 10-15% of homeowners replace their security screen doors annually, making way for a thriving second-hand market.</p> <ul> <li>Brands like Anderson and Pella have established a reputation for durability, often leading homeowners to sell their used models when upgrading.</li> <li>Local hardware stores frequently host sales on used security doors, giving homeowners a chance to find quality products at a fraction of the price.</li> <li>DIY enthusiasts often repurpose used security doors for creative projects, adding a unique touch to their home transformations.</li> </ul> <p>As you think about how to transform your home, remember that history is on your side.

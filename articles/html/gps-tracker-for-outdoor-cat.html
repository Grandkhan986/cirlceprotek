With over 10 million outdoor cats in the US, the question of how to keep them safe has been a pressing one for decades.</p> <p>Historically, cats have enjoyed a dual existence as companions and hunters, often exploring their neighborhoods with little regard for their owners' concerns.

This lack of reliable tracking led to a growing demand for solutions that would ensure that pet owners would never lose their feline companions again.</p> <p>Fast forward to the 21st century, where technological advancements have transformed the way we keep tabs on our pets. The introduction of GPS trackers has revolutionized the landscape of pet ownership, providing peace of mind that was previously unattainable.

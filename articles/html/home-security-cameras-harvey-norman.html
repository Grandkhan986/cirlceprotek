Fast forward to today, and the landscape has dramatically transformed. Now, with the advancement of technology, a simple camera can provide a level of safety that was once unimaginable. The evolution of home security systems has been pivotal in how we protect our homes, and Harvey Norman stands at the forefront of this transformation.</p> <p>Historically, the idea of securing a home revolved around physical deterrents. In the mid-20th century, homeowners relied heavily on alarm systems and neighborhood watch programs. However, with the rise of technology in the late 1990s and early 2000s, things began to shift.

The historical context of home security has paved the way for these advancements, making it more crucial than ever to stay vigilant and informed.</p></section><section id="tech"><h2 itemprop="about">Have You Ever Considered How</h2><p>Have you ever considered how a few innovative gadgets could transform your home into a sanctuary of safety?

Just a few decades ago, navigating through unfamiliar territory required a printed map and a keen sense of direction. Fast forward to today, and the advent of GPS technology has redefined how we traverse our surroundings. The concept of "Find Your Way" has evolved from physical maps to digital solutions, with online GPS tracking emerging as a pivotal tool in our daily lives.</p> <p>The journey of GPS technology began in the 1970s with the launch of the first GPS satellites, but it took until the late 1990s for the technology to become widely accessible to consumers. By then, basic handheld GPS devices had started to appear on the market, allowing adventurers to navigate trails and roads with newfound ease. However, it wasn't until the advent of smartphones in the late 2000s that GPS tracking truly entered the mainstream.</p> <p>Today, an estimated 70% of GPS tracking is conducted via online platforms or mobile apps, with many offering basic free tiers. This shift not only reflects the technological advancements but also a growing demand for affordable solutions.

Yet, as security measures became more accessible, so too did the methods employed by burglars.</p> <p>Transform your home by understanding the evolution of these security measures. High-security locks emerged in response to the growing sophistication of break-in techniques. Today, models from brands such as Medeco and Mul-T-Lock offer features like drill resistance and pick-proof technology.

Imagine a time when wooden doors were the standard, providing little more than a semblance of security. Over the years, as urban landscapes changed and crime rates climbed, the need for robust solutions became paramount. Transform your home from a mere dwelling into a fortress against threats with this innovative material that has stood the test of time.</p> <p>Historically, door frames made from wood were affordable and widely available, but they offered minimal resistance against forced entry.

Today, approximately 40% of new door frame installations in high-crime urban areas feature steel frames, a testament to their effectiveness and reliability.</p> <p>Steel door frames offer a remarkable increase in resistance to forced entry—up to 75% compared to their wooden counterparts. This enhancement stems from the inherent strength of steel, which can withstand significant force.

The transition from wood to steel is not merely a trend but a strategic shift towards safeguarding our spaces. Embracing steel door frames is a proactive step, allowing you to bolster your security while enhancing your home's overall appeal.</p></section><section id="tech"><h2 itemprop="about">What If Your Front Door</h2><p>What if your front door held the power to redefine safety in your home?

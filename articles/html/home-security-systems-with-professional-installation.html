From medieval castles fortified against invaders to the sleek, high-tech devices of today, the evolution of home security illustrates our enduring desire to protect what matters most. As we reflect on the past, it’s evident that transforming your safety has always been a priority, driven by innovation and necessity.</p> <p>In the early 20th century, home security systems were rudimentary at best. Most relied on physical barriers—heavy locks and wooden doors were the first lines of defense.

These systems were often DIY, leaving many homeowners to grapple with installation complexities.</p> <p>Fast forward to today, and the landscape of home security has transformed dramatically. The advent of smart technology has changed the game, making it easier than ever to monitor your home, whether you’re miles away or just down the street. With homes that feature professional installation of security systems being up to three times less likely to be burglarized, it’s clear that expertise matters. This shift in how we secure our homes has led to a surge in demand for professional services—approximately 80% of homeowners now prefer expert installation over DIY options.</p> <ul> <li><strong>ADT Security:</strong> With over 140 years in the business, ADT has become synonymous with home security, offering tailored solutions that fit any lifestyle.</li> <li><strong>Vivint:</strong> Known for its smart home integration, Vivint provides a seamless experience with professional installation that enhances both safety and convenience.</li> <li><strong>Frontpoint:</strong> This company emphasizes the importance of customer service alongside security, ensuring homeowners feel confident in their choices.</li> </ul> <p>Moreover, data indicates that investing in a professionally installed system can lead to homeowner's insurance premiums being reduced by up to 20%.

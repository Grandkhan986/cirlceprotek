In a world where personal safety is paramount, the revolutionary GPS personal alarm emerges not just as a tool, but as a beacon of hope. Yet, while this game-changing technology offers unprecedented security, it also faces a series of challenges that must be addressed to maximize its potential. How can we ensure that the revolutionary GPS personal alarm truly serves its purpose?</p> <p>One significant challenge is the technology's accessibility, particularly for older adults. With an estimated 1 in 4 adults over 65 experiencing a fall each year, many may struggle to navigate smartphone applications or complicated devices.

The journey of GPS family trackers began as a response to rising concerns over child safety, with families seeking innovative solutions to keep their children secure. With an estimated 1 in 10 families with children under 18 currently utilizing these devices, the historical context of GPS family trackers reveals a significant evolution in parental vigilance over the decades.

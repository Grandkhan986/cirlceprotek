With about 30% of Ring users utilizing the chime feature to monitor door activity, it has become a reliable method to never miss a visitor again. This small but powerful device not only alerts homeowners of incoming guests but also allows them to stay connected, even when they're away. For instance, imagine a busy parent who can’t always hear the doorbell ring due to household noise. With the chime, they receive instant notifications, ensuring they never miss a visitor again.</p> <ul> <li>Consider the case of a young professional living in a bustling city. The constant noise can drown out traditional doorbell sounds, making it easy to miss important deliveries or guests. With the Ring Security Chime, they feel reassured, knowing they’re instantly notified of any activity at their door.</li> <li>Another example involves a family with elderly relatives living nearby. By installing the chime, they ensure that they never miss a visitor again, providing peace of mind that their loved ones can easily reach them without feeling isolated.</li> </ul> <p>Approximately 85% of Ring users report feeling more secure knowing when their door opens, even when they’re not home.
